# OOP
Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Is a programming paradigm in which programs are organized around data, or based on the concept "objects", rather than functions and logic.

Basically an object can be defined as a data (attributes or properties) and behaviors (methods)

Simply put, OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. Due to the organization of an object-oriented program, this method is also conducive to collaborative development where projects can be divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability  and efficiency.

## Principles of OOP
Object-oriented programming is based on the following principles:

- ### Encapsulation
The implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined boundary, or class. Other objects do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes but are only able to call a list of public functions, or methods. This characteristic of data hiding provides greater program security and avoids unintended data corruption.

- ### Abstraction
Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code. This concept helps developers make changes and additions over time more easily.

- ### Inheritance
Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, allowing developers to reuse a common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy. This property of OOP forces a more thorough data analysis, reduces development time and ensures a higher level of accuracy.

- ### Polymorphism
Objects are allowed to take on more than one form depending on the context. The program will determine which 
meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of that object, cutting down on the need to duplicate code.

## Objects and classes
Exist two main concepts in OOP: Classes and objects.

**Classes**: Is a template that allow to create object, containt the definition of attributes and the procedure for the class
**Objects**: Instances of clases

Example:

**Class** Person

**Attributes**: name, last name, phone, address
**Methods**: getName, getLastName, getPhone, getAddress

**Objects**

- **Object 1** => name:Alejo, last name: Vargas Alvarez, phone: 0000000, address: Street 1234

- **Object 2** => name:Juan,  last name: Restrepo Perez, phone: 1111111, address: Street 2345.

We have two object with the same definition of class (or template) but with diferent information
