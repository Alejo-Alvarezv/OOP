## Inheritance
Inheritance is the mechanism by which an object acquires the some/all properties of another object.

In Oriented Object Programming, the computer programs are designed in such a way where everything is an object that interacts with one another object. It basically, helps in reusing the code and establish a relationship between different classes.

## Types of Inheritance
### Single Inheritance

In single inheritance, one class inherits the properties of another. It enables a derived class to inherit the properties and behavior from a single parent class. This will, in turn, enable code reusability as well as add new features to the existing code.

Here, Class A is your parent class and Class B is your child class which inherits the properties and behavior of the parent class

### Multiple Inheritance

### Multilevel Inheritance
When a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class, i.e. a class having more than one parent class but at different levels, such type of inheritance is called Multilevel Inheritance.

If we talk about the flowchart, class B inherits the properties and behavior of class A and class C inherits the properties of class B. Here A is the parent class for B and class B is the parent class for C. So in this case class C implicitly inherits the properties and methods of class A along with Class B. Thatâ€™s what is multilevel inheritance.

### Hierarchical Inheritance
When a class has more than one child classes (subclasses) or in other words, more than one child classes have the same parent class

### Hybrid Inheritance
Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.
